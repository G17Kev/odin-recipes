    <p>This lasagna with uncooked noodles is super easy and fast to make. It is made with a prepared sauce and requires no boiling of the noodles.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 (4.5 ounce) can mushrooms, drained</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package cottage cheese</li>
        <li>1 pint part-skim ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Make sauce: Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion and mushrooms; sauté until onions are transparent. Stir in pasta sauce and cook until heated through. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Make filling: Combine cottage cheese, ricotta, eggs, and Parmesan in a medium bowl and set aside.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of meat sauce in the bottom of a 13x9-inch dish. Layer with uncooked lasagna noodles, cheese filling, mozzarella, and meat sauce. Continue layering until all components are used, reserving 1/2 cup mozzarella. Cover the dish with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Remove foil and top with reserved 1/2 cup mozzarella. Continue baking until cheese is melted, about 15 more minutes. Let lasagna stand for 10 to 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
